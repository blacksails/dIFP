(* The goal of this project is to study
   how to filter elements in or out of lists.
*)

Require Import List Bool.

(* The Bool library defines
     true,
     false,
     andb (noted && in infix notation),
     orb (noted || in infix notation),
     and negb.
   It also provides the following equations:

    andb_true_l : forall b : bool, true && b = b
    andb_true_r : forall b : bool, b && true = b
   andb_false_l : forall b : bool, false && b = false
   andb_false_r : forall b : bool, b && false = false
    orb_false_l : forall b : bool, false || b = b
    orb_false_r : forall b : bool, b || false = b
     orb_true_r : forall b : bool, b || true = true
     orb_true_l : forall b : bool, true || b = true

   andb_true_iff
        : forall b1 b2 : bool, b1 && b2 = true <-> b1 = true /\ b2 = true
   andb_false_iff:
     forall b1 b2 : bool, b1 && b2 = false <-> b1 = false \/ b2 = false
   orb_false_iff
        : forall b1 b2 : bool, b1 || b2 = false <-> b1 = false /\ b2 = false
   orb_true_iff
        : forall b1 b2 : bool, b1 || b2 = true <-> b1 = true \/ b2 = true

You will also have the use of the two following unfold lemmas:
*)

Lemma unfold_negb_base_case_true :
  negb true = false.
Proof.
  unfold_tactic negb.
Qed.

Lemma unfold_negb_base_case_false :
  negb false = true.
Proof.
  unfold_tactic negb.
Qed.

(* Also, when, among the assumptions, you have
     H_foo : true = false
   remember that the command
     discriminate H_foo.
   solves the current subgoal.
*)

(* And finally, remember that
      destruct blah as [...] eqn:H_blah.
    has the niceness of adding an assumption H_blah
    that reflects the destruction.  For example,
    if foo has type bool,
      destruct foo as [ | ] eqn:H_foo.
    will successively provide
      H_foo : foo = true
    and then
      H_foo : foo = false
*)
